Observation:
- Password containing combination of Uppercase, Lowercase letters, Number and Symbol is very strong as the attackers cannot easily find the password with combinations.
- Giving Names as the password is easy to crack password as it can be guessed.
- Repeating same characters can be less complex and can be cracked.
- Common usage patterns can be easily detected and can lead to Credential Stuffing, Data Breaches.

Precautions:
- Use the combination of characters to make password strong and check for the password strength to make sure it is not easily cracked through any of the dictionary attack.
- Avoid usage of same password for all application as it puts accounts at risk if any of the one application is breached.
- Using auto generated is an alternate method to make it secure but the password stored in google account can be risky as it can be hacked.
- Be aware if any of the application you have been through is breached and take necessary action to secure other data.
